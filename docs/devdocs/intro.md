# Overview

Thank you for your interest in Fhenix! These documents contain everything you need to set up your environment and get started  creating smart contracts that use FHE with encrypted data!&#x20;

We explain how to use Fhenix with FHE to create privacy-preserving Web3 applications. We include an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) extension that enables operations on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). In addition, we have added special precompiles to the EVM that allow computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption.

We have also integrated FHE with Solidity. This means you can continue writing smart contracts with familiar syntax, while leveraging FHE capabilities.

This documentation contains guidance on operating on encrypted data, understanding patterns in FHE-friendly code, and access control in FHE-based smart contracts. 

Let's get started.
